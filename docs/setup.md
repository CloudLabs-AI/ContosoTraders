# Instructions

## Setting up TailwindTraders

1. Git clone this repository to your machine.
2. Provision the infrastructure on Azure by running the bicep scripts ([instructions here](../iac/readme.md)).
3. Create the necessary github secrets ([instructions here](../.github/workflows/secrets.md)).
4. To deploy the apps, run all the github workflows. You can do this by going to the github repo's `Actions` tab, selecting a workflow, and clicking on the `Run workflow` button.

## Setting up TailwindTraders in a lab

Same steps as above. But you have to create a fork of the [TailwindTraders github repository](https://github.com/CloudLabs-AI/TailwindTraders); one fork per lab.
